In this breast cancer prediction project, the data, sourced from Kaggle and conveniently located in the project folder, serves as the foundation for a comprehensive exploration of predictive modeling. The dataset comprises various features related to cancer diagnosis, including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension, among others. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase involves a thorough examination of the dataset's structure, statistics, and distribution, revealing essential insights into its characteristics. With a focus on breast cancer prediction, the data undergoes preprocessing steps, including the transformation of the diagnosis column into binary values (1 for malignant, 0 for benign) and standard scaling for feature normalization. Two distinct machine learning models, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), are employed for predictive analysis. The Naive Bayes model achieves an accuracy of 95%, showcasing its effectiveness in distinguishing between malignant and benign cases. Similarly, the KNN model, with an accuracy of 95.6%, demonstrates robust performance in breast cancer prediction. This project not only contributes valuable insights into cancer diagnosis but also provides a solid framework for future enhancements and explorations in the realm of medical predictive modeling.
