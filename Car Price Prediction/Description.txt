This project, focused on car price prediction, leverages a dataset sourced from Kaggle, conveniently provided in the project folder. The workflow includes rigorous data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of three regression modelsâ€”Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Decision Tree Regression. Through statistical analysis and compelling visualizations, the intricacies of the dataset are unveiled, revealing key patterns and correlations. The predictive modeling phase employs classic linear regression, the robust ensemble technique of Random Forest Regression, and the decision tree-based model. Model performance is thoroughly evaluated using pertinent metrics, facilitating a comparative analysis to determine the most effective model for predicting car prices.
