In this fraud transaction prediction analysis, a dataset containing over six million financial transactions was explored and preprocessed. The data included features such as transaction type, amount, and various balances, with the objective of predicting fraudulent transactions. Initial data exploration and cleaning involved handling missing values, renaming columns, and addressing data imbalances. The distribution of transaction types was visualized, revealing a focus on 'TRANSFER' and 'CASH_OUT.' Outliers were identified and removed, and the dataset was then sampled to address the class imbalance. A logistic regression model was employed, achieving high accuracy. Additionally, a custom model was designed, incorporating both historical fraud patterns and machine learning classification. The analysis emphasizes key features, such as destination balances, transaction types, and historical fraud patterns, contributing to a comprehensive approach in predicting fraudulent activities in financial transactions.
