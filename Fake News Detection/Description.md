The project aims to classify fake news by employing machine learning techniques. It involves the preprocessing of a dataset comprising news articles, including the removal of duplicate entries and handling missing values, resulting in a refined dataset. The text data is split into training and testing sets. The project implements a Naive Bayes model using a pipeline approach, incorporating TF-IDF vectorization and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. The best-performing model, Bernoulli Naive Bayes with specific parameters (alpha=0.1, fit_prior=False), achieves an accuracy of 93% on the test data. Additionally, a LimeModel class is defined to facilitate explanations of model predictions. Overall, this project presents a comprehensive framework for fake news classification using machine learning techniques, achieving notable accuracy in distinguishing between real and fake news articles.
