The Brain Tumor Classification project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras to categorize brain MRI images into glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor classes. Preprocessed and augmented with TensorFlow's image preprocessing tools, the dataset contains 1311 images resized to 256x256 pixels. The CNN architecture comprises multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers, culminating in dense layers for classification, achieving approximately 96% accuracy on the test set after 50 epochs. This project aims to contribute to medical image analysis, aiding healthcare professionals in precise tumor identification. Through visualizing accuracy and loss curves, as well as displaying sample images with their predicted classes, the project demonstrates the model's ability to accurately classify brain tumor images, potentially enhancing diagnostic processes in healthcare settings. Future improvements may include exploring transfer learning and deploying the model as a diagnostic tool in clinical environments.
