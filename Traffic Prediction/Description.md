In this traffic prediction project, data sourced from Kaggle and conveniently located in the project folder is utilized for predicting traffic situations based on various factors. The dataset encompasses key features such as CarCount, BikeCount, BusCount, and TruckCount, along with the corresponding Traffic Situation labels. Following a crucial step of data splitting into training and test sets, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is employed for model development. With k set to 5, the model is trained on the training set and subsequently used for making predictions on the test set. The evaluation of the model's performance is articulated through a comprehensive classification report, detailing precision, recall, and F1-score for each traffic situation class, namely heavy, high, low, and normal. The achieved accuracy of 94% underscores the effectiveness of the KNN classifier in predicting traffic situations.
