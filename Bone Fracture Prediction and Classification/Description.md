In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras to classify bone fractures based on X-ray images. The dataset consists of 1725 images belonging to 12 fracture classes, such as Avulsion fracture, Comminuted fracture, and Compression-Crush fracture. The model architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling, and dense layers for effective feature extraction and classification. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, with data augmentation applied to enhance model generalization. The training process involves optimizing with Adam optimizer and learning rate scheduling. Early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting. The model achieves promising results with an accuracy of 72.66% on the test set. Visualization of training and validation metrics is provided using Matplotlib, showcasing the model's learning progress over 28 epochs.
